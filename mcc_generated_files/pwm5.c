   @Summary
     This is the generated driver implementation file for the PWM5 driver using MPLAB(c) Code Configurator
 
   @Description
     This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for PWM5.
     Generation Information :
         Product Revision  :  MPLAB(c) Code Configurator - 4.15.3
         Device            :  PIC16LF18346
         Driver Version    :  2.00
     The generated drivers are tested against the following:
         Compiler          :  XC8 1.35
         MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.40
